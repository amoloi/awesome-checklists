## Creating a checklist
Thanks to [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), you can [create Task lists with ease](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents).
```
 - [ ] Item 1
 - [ ] Item 2
 - [x] Item 3 (use an 'x' to put a checkmark)
 - [ ] Item 4
```
Which looks like this once rendered:

- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
- [x] Item 3
- [ ] Item 4

As you can see, they render as read-only checkboxes in Markdown files. People with write permissions in the repository can edit the file to select or unselect the checkboxes.
